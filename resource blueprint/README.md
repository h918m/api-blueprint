# Resource Blueprint
A proposal of resource-oriented, protocol-independent [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org). This proposal is focused on modeling API resources, its attributes, affordances and an API state machine.

## Use Case API
As an use-case API the Resource Blueprint uses [Gist Fox API](../examples/Gist%20Fox%20API.md). To demonstrate the description of the API state machine the Gist Fox API is extended with additional resource states.

The actual proposal source can be found in the [Gist API.md](Gist%20API.md) file.

## Gist State Machine

### Gists Resource 
An entry point to Resource Blueprint Gist API is the `Gists` resource in its `collection` state. This resource has two states: `collection` and 
`navigation`:

> **Note:** Collection essentially servers a factory for individual entities.
