# Grouping Resources API
This API example demonstrates how to group resources and form **groups of resources** (documentation chapters if you will). You can create as many or as few groups as you like. If you do not create any group all your resources will be part of an "unnamed" group.

# Group One
This is the first group of resources in this document. It is **recognized** by the **keyword `group`** and its name is `One`. 

Any following resource definition is considered to be a part of this group until another group is defined. It is **customary** to increase header level of resources (and methods) nested under a resource.
