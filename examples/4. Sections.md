# Named Resource and Methods API 
This API example demonstrates multiple logical sections for your resources. You can create as many or as few of sections as you like. If you do not create any section all your resources are part of "unnamed" section.

Remember the very first (named) group has to be separated from this discusion by a Markdown horizontal rule e.g. `---`.

# My First Section
This is the first resource section in this document. Any resource that follows is part of this section until another section header is met. It is **customary** to increase header level of resources (and methods) nested under a section.

## My Super Awesome Message [/resource]
OK `My Super Awesome Message` probably isn't the best name for our resource but its 1AM OK? Note the URI `/resource` is enclosed in square brackets. 

### Retrieve Message [GET]
Now this is informative! No extra explanaition needed here. This method clearly retrieves the message.

+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Response from our resource!
        
### Create Messge [POST]
Crete a message. Nice and tidy.

+ Request (text/plain)

        A message to be posted.
        
+ Response 201 (text/plain)

        Created.

# My Second Section
This is second section in this document. For now no resources were defined here.
